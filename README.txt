Be careful!
	
	VCC to 5V 

	GND to GND

	TXT to PA10 (USART1_RX)

NOTE: When you generate the code, use to my main.c code. Copy all of its content and replace it with the main.c file generated by the program.

If you don't want to deal with these steps, you can simply upload the .hex file I provided at the same location. However, you won't be able to modify that project. You can use to "STM32CubeProgrammer" for this.
